# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis — Turning Raw Data into Business Insights

## 🧠 Overview  
This project demonstrates how I cleaned, explored, and analyzed messy sales data to uncover **actionable insights** for smarter business decisions.  
Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, I transformed raw CSV data into meaningful metrics that reveal product performance, revenue trends, and sales behavior across territories.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Handled **missing values**, **duplicates**, and **inconsistent column names** using `Pandas`.  
- Standardized date formats and corrected data types for seamless analysis.  
- Ensured accuracy across thousands of transactional records.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Analyzed multiple dimensions to uncover performance drivers:  
- **Top 10 Selling Items** — by total order quantity.

Included multiple chart types to make insights intuitive and presentation-ready:  
- **Bar Charts** — for top-selling items and shop performance.  
- **Line Chart** — for monthly sales trend.  
- **Pie Chart** — for department and area contribution.  

📂 All charts are available in the `outputs/` folder for easy reference.

2. **Seasonal Trends** – Sales spike mid-year, highlighting potential for marketing push in those months.  
3. **Regional Imbalance** – Two territories dominate revenue, suggesting untapped potential in underperforming areas.
